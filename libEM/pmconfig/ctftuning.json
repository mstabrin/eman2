You almost never want to do this, as it's best to compute structure factors on only the best particle stacks. Initially the high resolution domains of the GroEL structure factors are used during CTF determination, however if 'sf' is set to auto, previously determined structure factors for this molecule are used if available(otherwise GroEL is used. To force GroEL use set 'sf' to none",
